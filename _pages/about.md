Undergraduate Student at Shandong University

I am currently a senior student from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Shandong University. I have joined Taishan College as a core member.

I am currently a research intern at the Institute of Intelligent Computing (IIC, SDU). I am grateful to be advised by Dr. Pengfei Hu and Dr. Xiuzhen Cheng.

My research interests lie in the intersection of multisource information fusion perception (multimodal perception), cognitive reasoning, and embodied intelligence.  My long-term goal is to create embodied intelligent agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, understanding the real world, and interacting with it using multiple sources of information.
